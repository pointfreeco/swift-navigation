  /// Tracks access to properties of an observable model.
  ///
  /// This function allows one to minimally observe changes in a model in order to
  /// react to those changes. For example, if you had an observable model like so:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// @Observable
  /// class FeatureModel {
  ///   var count = 0
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Then you can use `observe` to observe changes in the model. For example, in UIKit you can
  /// update a `UILabel`:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// observe { [weak self] in
  ///   guard let self else { return }
  ///
  ///   countLabel.text = "Count: \(model.count)"
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Anytime the `count` property of the model changes the trailing closure will be invoked again,
  /// allowing you to update the view. Further, only changes to properties accessed in the trailing
  /// closure will be observed.
  ///
  /// > Note: If you are targeting Apple's older platforms (anything before iOS 17, macOS 14,
  /// > tvOS 17, watchOS 10), then you can use our
  /// > [Perception](http://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-perception) library to replace Swift's
  /// > Observation framework.
  ///
  /// This function also works on non-Apple platforms, such as Windows, Linux, Wasm, and more. For
  /// example, in a Wasm app you could observe changes to the `count` property to update the inner
  /// HTML of a tag:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// import JavaScriptKit
  ///
  /// var countLabel = document.createElement("span")
  /// _ = document.body.appendChild(countLabel)
  ///
  /// let token = observe {
  ///   countLabel.innerText = .string("Count: \(model.count)")
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// And you can also build your own tools on top of `observe`.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - isolation: The isolation of the observation.
  ///   - apply: A closure that contains properties to track.
  /// - Returns: A token that keeps the subscription alive. Observation is cancelled when the token
  ///   is deallocated.
