    ///
    /// SwiftUI comes with a `popover(item:)` view modifier that is powered by a binding to some
    /// identifiable state. When this state becomes non-`nil`, it passes an unwrapped value to the
    /// content closure. This value, however, is completely static, which prevents the popover from
    /// modifying it.
    ///
    /// This overload differs in that it passes a _binding_ to the unwrapped value, instead. This
    /// gives the popover the ability to write changes back to its source of truth.
    ///
    /// Also unlike `popover(item:)`, the binding's value does _not_ need to be identifiable, and
    /// can instead specify a key path to the provided data's identifier.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct TimelineView: View {
    ///   @State var draft: Post?
    ///
    ///   var body: Body {
    ///     Button("Compose") {
    ///       self.draft = Post()
    ///     }
    ///     .popover(item: $draft) { $draft in
    ///       ComposeView(post: $draft, onSubmit: { ... })
    ///     }

    /// struct ComposeView: View {
    ///   @Binding var post: Post

    ///     Changes made to the popover's binding will be reflected back in the source of truth.
    ///     Likewise, changes to `item` are instantly reflected in the popover. If `item` becomes
