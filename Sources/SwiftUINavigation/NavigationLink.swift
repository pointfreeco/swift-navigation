  ///     destination can use this binding to produce its content and write changes back to the
  ///     source of truth. Upstream changes to `value` will also be instantly reflected in the
  ///     destination. If `value` becomes `nil`, the destination is dismissed.
  ///   - onNavigate: A closure that executes when the link becomes active or inactive with a
  ///     boolean that describes if the link was activated or not. Use this closure to populate the
  ///     source of truth when it is passed a value of `true`. When passed `false`, the system will
  ///     automatically write `nil` to `value`.
  ///   - destination: A view for the navigation link to present.
  ///   - label: A view builder to produce a label describing the `destination` to present.
