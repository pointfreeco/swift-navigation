  extension View {
    /// Presents an alert from a binding to an optional value.
    ///
    /// SwiftUI's `alert` view modifiers are driven by two disconnected pieces of state: an
    /// `isPresented` binding to a boolean that determines if the alert should be presented, and
    /// optional alert `data` that is used to customize its actions and message.
    ///
    /// Modeling the domain in this way unfortunately introduces a couple invalid runtime states:
    ///
    ///   * `isPresented` can be `true`, but `data` can be `nil`.
    ///   * `isPresented` can be `false`, but `data` can be non-`nil`.
    ///
    /// On top of that, SwiftUI's `alert` modifiers take static titles, which means the title cannot
    /// be dynamically computed from the alert data.
    ///
    /// This overload addresses these shortcomings with a streamlined API. First, it eliminates the
    /// invalid runtime states at compile time by driving the alert's presentation from a single,
    /// optional binding. When this binding is non-`nil`, the alert will be presented. Further, the
    /// title can be customized from the alert data.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct AlertDemo: View {
    ///   @State var randomMovie: Movie?
    ///
    ///   var body: some View {
    ///     Button("Pick a random movie", action: self.getRandomMovie)
    ///       .alert(
    ///         title: { Text($0.title) },
    ///         unwrapping: self.$randomMovie,
    ///         actions: { _ in
    ///           Button("Pick another", action: self.getRandomMovie)
    ///         },
    ///         message: { Text($0.summary) }
    ///       )
    ///   }
    ///
    ///   func getRandomMovie() {
    ///     self.randomMovie = Movie.allCases.randomElement()
    ///   }
    /// }
    /// ```
