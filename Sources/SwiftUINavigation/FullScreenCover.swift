    /// Presents a full-screen cover using a binding as a data source for the sheet's content.
    ///
    /// SwiftUI comes with a `fullScreenCover(item:)` view modifier that is powered by a binding to
    /// some identifiable state. When this state becomes non-`nil`, it passes an unwrapped value to
    /// the content closure. This value, however, is completely static, which prevents the sheet
    /// from modifying it.
    ///
    /// This overload differs in that it passes a _binding_ to the unwrapped value, instead. This
    /// gives the sheet the ability to write changes back to its source of truth.
    ///
    /// Also unlike `fullScreenCover(item:)`, the binding's value does _not_ need to be
    /// identifiable, and can instead specify a key path to the provided data's identifier.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct TimelineView: View {
    ///   @State var draft: Post?
    ///
    ///   var body: Body {
    ///     Button("Compose") {
    ///       self.draft = Post()
    ///     }
    ///     .fullScreenCover(item: $draft, id: \.id) { $draft in
    ///       ComposeView(post: $draft, onSubmit: { ... })
    ///     }
