  /// Presents a full-screen cover using a binding as a data source for the sheet's content.
  ///
  /// SwiftUI comes with a `fullScreenCover(item:)` view modifier that is powered by a binding to
  /// some hashable state. When this state becomes non-`nil`, it passes an unwrapped value to the
  /// content closure. This value, however, is completely static, which prevents the sheet from
  /// modifying it.
  ///
  /// This overload differs in that it passes a _binding_ to the unwrapped value, instead. This
  /// gives the sheet the ability to write changes back to its source of truth.
  ///
  /// Also unlike `fullScreenCover(item:)`, the binding's value does _not_ need to be hashable.
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// struct TimelineView: View {
  ///   @State var draft: Post?
  ///
  ///   var body: Body {
  ///     Button("Compose") {
  ///       self.draft = Post()
  ///     }
  ///     .fullScreenCover(unwrapping: self.$draft) { $draft in
  ///       ComposeView(post: $draft, onSubmit: { ... })
  ///     }
  ///   }
  /// }
  ///
  /// struct ComposeView: View {
  ///   @Binding var post: Post
  ///   var body: some View { ... }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - value: A binding to a source of truth for the sheet. When `value` is non-`nil`, a
  ///     non-optional binding to the value is passed to the `content` closure. You use this binding
  ///     to produce content that the system presents to the user in a sheet. Changes made to the
  ///     sheet's binding will be reflected back in the source of truth. Likewise, changes to
  ///     `value` are instantly reflected in the sheet. If `value` becomes `nil`, the sheet is
  ///     dismissed.
  ///   - onDismiss: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
  ///   - content: A closure returning the content of the sheet.

  /// A version of `fullScreenCover(unwrapping:)` that works with enum state.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - enum: A binding to an optional enum that holds the source of truth for the sheet at a
  ///     particular case. When `enum` is non-`nil`, and `casePath` successfully extracts a value, a
  ///     non-optional binding to the value is passed to the `content` closure. You use this binding
  ///     to produce content that the system presents to the user in a sheet. Changes made to the
  ///     sheet's binding will be reflected back in the source of truth. Likewise, changes to `enum`
  ///     at the given case are instantly reflected in the sheet. If `enum` becomes `nil`, or
  ///     becomes a case other than the one identified by `casePath`, the sheet is dismissed.
  ///   - casePath: A case path that identifies a case of `enum` that holds a source of truth for
  ///     the sheet.
  ///   - onDismiss: The closure to execute when dismissing the sheet.
  ///   - content: A closure returning the content of the sheet.
